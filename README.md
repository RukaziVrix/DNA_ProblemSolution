# DNA_ProblemSolution

Hello and welcome to my solution to ASCII to DNA Problem!

List Of Classes
-------------------
DNA_WorkFlow
	-Where all my logic is store

VIEW
------------------
GUI
	-Handles all the printing done to the Console

MODELS
------------------
DNA
	-Stores DNA make up with some simple override methods
RNA
	-Stores RNA make up with some simple override methods

Interfaces
------------------
IAscii
	-methods for encoding ASCII to DNA solution
	
	
	
	On Objective 1 I've completed require requirements
	On Objective 2 I've completed require requirements
	On Objective 3 I'm missing the interface requirement for = should	provide	the	zero-based index	where	the	
substring	begins	or	-1	if	it	does	not	exist
	Wasn't sure why that would have to be located their, so I opted out untill reason.
	On Objective 4 I've completed requirements, but I assume the user will prefer to type ASCII Text instead of DNA Code
	On Objective 5 I've completed require requirements, but I assume to keep LCS in the same interface as the rest
	
	Extra
	Made it possible for the user to Convert DNA code back to ASCII Text
